2. **HackerRank Challenge**: Solve the "Validating and Parsing Email Addresses" challenge on HackerRank.

## Functional Programming

1. **Higher-Order Function**: Implement a higher-order function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of squares of even numbers.

## Lambda Functions

1. **Sorting with Lambda**: Sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key using a lambda function.

## Closures

1. **Function Call Counter**: Create a closure that counts the number of times a function is called.

## Contextlib Module

1. **Logging Context Manager**: Use the `contextlib` module to create a context manager that logs entry and exit to a function.

## Decorators with Arguments

1. **Flexible Decorators**: Create a decorator that accepts arguments and can be used with or without parentheses.

## Asynchronous Programming

1. **Async Data Fetching**: Write an asynchronous function that fetches data from multiple URLs concurrently using the `asyncio` library.

## Descriptors

1. **Value Validation**: Define a class with a descriptor that validates and stores a value within a specific range.

## Metaprogramming

1. **Dynamic Class Generation**: Create a function that dynamically generates classes with properties and methods based on user input.

## File Handling

1. **Efficient CSV Reading**: Learn how to read a large CSV file line by line and extract specific columns without loading the entire file into memory.

## JSON Serialization

1. **Custom JSON Serialization**: Implement custom JSON serialization and deserialization methods for a user-defined class.

## Unit Testing

1. **Test Your Code**: Write unit tests for a class or function using the `unittest` or `pytest` framework, including test fixtures and assertions.
